The key idea is that your monorepo contains the _source code_ and _build/deployment configurations_ for all services, but the build and deployment processes treat each service as a distinct unit.

Here's the role each tool plays:

### 1. Docker: Packaging Each Service

- **What it is:** Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside **containers**. A container packages your application code along with all its dependencies (libraries, runtime, system tools) into a standardized, isolated unit.
    
- **Your Use Case:**
    
    - You will create a separate `Dockerfile` for _each_ of your services (e.g., `Dockerfile.interview`, `Dockerfile.ai`, `Dockerfile.signaling`, `Dockerfile.gateway`) within your monorepo.
        
    - Each `Dockerfile` will contain instructions specific to building _one_ service. For example, `Dockerfile.interview` will:
        
        - Start from a base Go image.
            
        - Copy the necessary source code (potentially using `go mod vendor` or Go workspaces to manage dependencies efficiently within the monorepo context).
            
        - Compile _only_ the Interview Service binary (`cmd/interview-service/main.go`).
            
        - Set up the final container environment, exposing the necessary port (e.g., the gRPC port for the Interview Service).
            
        - _(Best Practice: Use multi-stage builds in your Dockerfiles to keep the final container images small, containing only the compiled binary and necessary runtime files, not the entire Go toolchain or source code)._
            
    - You will use the `docker build` command, specifying the correct `Dockerfile` (e.g., `docker build -f Dockerfile.interview -t my-registry/interview-service:v1.0 .`), to create a distinct **Docker image** for each service.
        
    - These images are then pushed to a **container registry** (like Docker Hub, Google Container Registry (GCR), AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR)) so Kubernetes can pull them.
        

**In short: Docker lets you package each microservice independently, even if the source lives together.**

### 2. Kubernetes (k8s): Orchestrating the Services

- **What it is:** Kubernetes is a powerful open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It's the orchestrator that runs your Docker containers in a cluster of machines (nodes).
    
- **Your Use Case:**
    
    - You will define the desired state of your application using Kubernetes configuration files (usually written in YAML).
        
    - You'll create separate YAML manifests for _each_ service, defining resources like:
        
        - **`Deployment`**: Tells Kubernetes how to run your service. It specifies which Docker image to use (e.g., `my-registry/interview-service:v1.0`), how many replicas (copies/instances) of the service's container (called a **Pod**) should run, and how to handle updates. You'll have one `Deployment` per service (Interview, AI, Signaling, Gateway).
            
        - **`Service`**: Provides a stable network endpoint (IP address and DNS name within the cluster) for accessing the Pods managed by a `Deployment`. This is crucial for inter-service communication. For example, the AI Service will talk to the Interview Service using its Kubernetes `Service` name (e.g., `interview-service`), not a specific Pod IP address. Kubernetes handles the load balancing between the Pod replicas behind the `Service`.
            
        - **`ConfigMap`** / **`Secret`**: Used to inject configuration (like database URLs, API keys) into your service containers without hardcoding them in the image.
            
        - **`(Optional) Ingress`**: Manages external access (e.g., from the internet) to your services, typically routing HTTP/S traffic. Your API Gateway's `Service` would likely be exposed externally via an `Ingress` resource.
            
    - You apply these YAML files to your Kubernetes cluster (using `kubectl apply -f <your-yaml-file.yaml>`), and Kubernetes works to make the actual state match your desired state.
        

**In short: Kubernetes takes your independent service images (built by Docker) and runs/manages them as a cohesive application, handling networking, scaling, and resilience.**

### 3. Minikube: Running Kubernetes Locally

- **What it is:** Minikube is a tool that lets you run a _single-node_ Kubernetes cluster on your local machine (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
    
- **Your Use Case:**
    
    - Since you're new to k8s, Minikube is perfect for learning and development.
        
    - You can install Minikube, start a local cluster (`minikube start`), and then use `kubectl` (the Kubernetes command-line tool) to deploy your containerized services (defined by your YAML files) onto this local cluster.
        
    - This allows you to test the full application, including the gRPC communication between your services using Kubernetes `Service` discovery, exactly as it would run in a larger cloud environment, but all on your own computer.
        
    - Minikube often has integrations to directly use Docker images you build locally, simplifying the development loop (e.g., using `minikube image load my-registry/interview-service:v1.0` or configuring your Docker daemon to use Minikube's Docker environment).
        

**In short: Minikube provides a local Kubernetes playground for you to deploy and test your containerized microservices before moving to a production cluster.**

### The Workflow Summary

1. **Code:** Develop features for one or more services within your monorepo (`ai-interview-backend/`).
    
2. **Package (Docker):** Build a specific Docker image for _each_ service that changed, using its dedicated `Dockerfile` (e.g., `docker build -f Dockerfile.interview ...`).
    
3. **Store (Registry):** Push the built image(s) to a container registry.
    
4. **Define (Kubernetes YAML):** Create/update Kubernetes YAML manifests (`Deployment`, `Service`, etc.) for each service. These files can also live within your monorepo, perhaps in a `kubernetes/` directory.
    
5. **Deploy (Kubernetes/Minikube):** Apply the YAML manifests to your cluster (Minikube for local testing) using `kubectl apply`. Kubernetes pulls the specified images from the registry and runs your services.
    

So, the monorepo helps organize the source and configuration, while Docker, Kubernetes, and Minikube provide the tools to build, deploy, and manage each service as an independent unit.
