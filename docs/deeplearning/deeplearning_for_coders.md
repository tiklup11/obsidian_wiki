# Intro
- Neural networks dont require us to build features they build them for us.
- We dont give it features to train on, we ask it to learn features.
- Usecases like the following are now possible coz we dont have to figure out the features ourselfs instread the neural-net model does it for us.

## Features that model learn - visual rep - [object ditection]

### Usecases
- Natural language processing (NLP):: Answering questions; speech recognition; summarizing documents; classifying documents; finding names, dates, etc. in documents; searching for articles mentioning a concept
- Computer vision:: Satellite and drone imagery interpretation (e.g., for disaster resilience); face recognition; image captioning; reading traffic signs; locating pedestrians and vehicles in autonomous vehicles
- Medicine:: Finding anomalies in radiology images, including CT, MRI, and X-ray images; counting features in pathology slides; measuring features in ultrasounds; diagnosing diabetic retinopathy
- Biology:: Folding proteins; classifying proteins; many genomics tasks, such as tumor-normal sequencing and classifying clinically actionable genetic mutations; cell classification; analyzing protein/protein interactions
- Image generation:: Colorizing images; increasing image resolution; removing noise from images; converting images to art in the style of famous artists
Recommendation systems:: Web search; product recommendations; home page layout
- Playing games:: Chess, Go, most Atari video games, and many real-time strategy games
- Robotics:: Handling objects that are challenging to locate (e.g., transparent, shiny, lacking texture) or hard to pick up
- Other applications:: Financial and logistical forecasting, text to speech, and much more...
